# budget-tracker

This is a web app that tracks your Budget.

You can add incomes and expenses and the app can calculate your total remaining budget and shows your total expenses/income.

You are able to Create a payment, Read the payment, Edit the payment and Delete the payment.

I now plan on adding local storage and updating the design
